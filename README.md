# PacketSquirrel
My custom payloads for the Packet Squirrel.

# Overview
These are simplified payloads I have created for the Packet Squirrel.  The payloads should be easy to read and modify.

More details on the Packet Squirrel can be found at https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/categories/360000982574-Packet-Squirrel

## Howto
Plug the Packet Squirrel Ethernet In port into your computer.  Place the Packet Squirrel in Arming Mode and SSH to root@172.16.32.1.  Cd into switch1, switch2, or switch3 and replace the default payload.  Do not save your old payloads with a similar name in the same directory.  This can cause issues.
